		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Adults are defined as obese if their body mass index (BMI) is greater than or equal to 30kg/mÂ².
		
		Estimates for adults (aged 18 years and over) classified as obese were fully revised by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities in May 2023 with all previously published data overwritten. The replacement of all previously published data was required as the adjustments applied to the self-reported height and weight data have been updated and published by NHS Digital in the [Health Survey for England predicting height, weight and body mass index from self-reported data](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/areas-of-interest/public-health/health-survey-for-england-predicting-height-weight-and-body-mass-index-from-self-reported-data) report. The updated adjustments for height and weight have been applied to the new data point (November 2021 to 2022) and the whole back series (November 2015 to 2016 to November 2020 to 2021).
