            "description": "This dataset shows apprenticeships started by adults aged 16+ based on home address, rate per 100,000 population, in Northern Ireland, for academic years 2017/18 to 2021/22.\n\n### Coverage \n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Government Districts,\nNation (Northern Ireland)\n\n### Source\n\n - Northern Ireland: [Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland)](https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/publications/apprenticeshipsni-ad-hoc-tables) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n- Data relate to participants who have been on their course 28 days or more.\n - Geography is based upon the home postcode of the learner.\n - This dataset includes level 2 and level 3 apprenticeship qualification data.\n - [2022 mid-year population estimates for Northern Ireland](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2022-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland) have been used to create a rate per 100,000 population.\n - Figures produced by each UK nation may differ due to differing sources, time periods, age analysed or differences in methodologies so they are not directly comparable.\n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
